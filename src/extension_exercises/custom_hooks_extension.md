## Extension

Create a new component that calls your custom hook and returns data from a *different* API (SWAPI might be a good one!). Render the data on the screen.

Create a new custom hook, this time called `useToggle` that lets you toggle different things. This could be used for toggling a theme, a modal or anything else that you can think of!
